# NeuralNetwork-Project

In this project, I have discovered how to use a convolutional neural network along with a 
long-short- term memory network to accomplish human action recognition on videos. TensorFlow will be used
twice, with two distinct structures and methods. Then weâ€™ll use the model that performs the best
to make predictions about YouTube videos. In the input sequence (video), a CNN will be used to
extract spatial features at a specific time step, and an LSTM will be used to determine the temporal
relationships between the frames.
With the current trend of deep learning, CNN and RNN architectures have become more prevalent,and the use 
of deep learning models to train time series of inertial sensor data is still being investigated
by researchers. CNN and RNN deep learning models focus on a data-driven approach using sequential
information to learn discriminating qualities from raw sensor data.
